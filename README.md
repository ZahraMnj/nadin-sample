This a Vue project, using Ant Design and typescripr.
...................................................


It gets your name and save it in localhost, shows it in dashboard and it is editable in profile tab.
You van see current time in dashboard tab, too.


In the todos tab, yoa can add, remove or check an item.


The next tab, Weather sows an autocomplete input which you can enter name of a city, but it doesnt show the relevant weather (weathr box is just a sample),because of the lack of time i couldnt figure out how to import lat ang lng properties and bind it to weather information.


There is a language box in the last part which save the language selected in localhost but it doesnt change anything. I couldnt finish this part too.
